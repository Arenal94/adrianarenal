    <h2>Hobbies and Sports career</h2>
    <p>
      Although I spent a bunch of hours programming, I'm a very sporty person.
      Also, I love travelling and recording wonderful landscapes with my drone.
      I'm very into Martial arts too, in my spare time I like watching UFC (or
      whatever) combats.
    </p>

      Regarding my sports career, I had a great success doing karate when I was
      young. I started competing as a child and I achieved several trophies not
      only in regional tournaments but also in national ones. Due to injuries
      and studies, I had to stop doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, I started playing soccer. It was a great year and I had
      fantastic memories with my teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two years I gave Kick Boxing & Full Contact a try, but the
      injuries I had from Karate came back again so I had to stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next step was to join the indoor football team of my city. I made a lot
      of friends there (and also, many goals). During my last year with the
      team, I was the captain, and also the trainer of the cadet team and they
      end up winning the regional championship! They really did me very proud!
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm doing boxing. I hope my injuries can give me a break to let
      me enjoy this beautiful sport!
