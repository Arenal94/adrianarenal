    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Adrian Arenal, a Software Engineer from Pola de Siero (Asturias,
      Spain).
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favourite things about web development is to animate the
      interface, to make it alive, joyfull or even funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is not an easy task. Animations must deal with some other
      aspects like UX / UI design!
    </p>
    <p>
      I will use this website as my very own gallery, so I hope you can get to
      know me better through them!
    </p>
    <p>
      For those who are curious about the technologies involved in the
      development of this project, the open-source code is available in this
      <a href="https://github.com/AdrianArenal/adrianarenal" target="_blank"
        >repository</a
      >. Feel free to check the code and propose any change that may improve
      this website!
